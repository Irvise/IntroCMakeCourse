# Problem Statement

You want your C++ code to compile on other computers, not just your laptop.

 - group workstation
 - HPC compile node
 - collaborator laptops

Everyone should end up with a program that behaves the same way, wherever they build.

# Enter CMake

You describe _targets_ (what to build), _inputs_ (the sources files), and _configuration_ (what libraries to use, what compiler settings, etc.).

CMake uses that with its own _rules_ (how to turn sources into programs) to generate makefiles, IDE projects, or other outputs. CMake doesn't build your project itself!

CMake works on Linux, Windows, macOS and more.

# Getting Started

Checkpoint 0 is a simple "hello, world" program written in C++. Let's use CMake to build it.

```
$ cd checkpoint_0
```

# `CMakeLists.txt`

This is where you write the definitions of your targets and configuration.

Let's look at the sample `CMakeLists.txt` line by line.

# CMake has changed a lot

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
```

Tells CMake which version we used, affecting the features available and the interpretation of `CMakeLists.txt`

# Define a project

```
project(IntroCMakeCourse LANGUAGES CXX)
```

We have a project called `IntroCMakeCourse`, in the C++ language.

# Configure the compiler

```
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
```

We're using the C++17 language dialect.

# Tell it what to build

```
add_executable(main_executable main.cpp)
```

There is a program, called `main_executable`, which depends on the source code in `main.cpp`

# Using CMake

It's typical to build "out of tree", by running CMake in a separate place. Keeps generated files out of your source folder.

```
checkpoint0$ mkdir build
checkpoint0$ cd build
build$ cmake ..
[...]
-- Build files have been written to: /Users/gralee/OxfordRSE/IntroCMakeCourse/checkpoint_0/build
```

# Build your project

CMake only generated the build script, it didn't actually compile anything.

```
build$ make
[...]
[100%] Built target main_executable
build$ ./main_executable 
Checkpoint 0
Hello, World!
```

# Choosing a generator

CMake can create more than Makefiles. It can generate IDE projects, or build descriptions for the fast Ninja tool.

```
build$ cmake -G Ninja ..
[...]

build$ ninja
[2/2] Linking CXX executable main_executable
```
# Setting configuration

You (and users) can override choices made by CMake using the `-D` argument.

```
build$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-10 ..
-- Configuring done
You have changed variables that require your cache to be deleted.
Configure will be re-run and you may have to reset some variables.
The following variables have changed:
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER= /usr/local/bin/g++-10

-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 10.2.0
[...]
```

# Checkpoint 0

# Adding subdirectories

    CMakeLists.txt/
    src/
      CMakeLists.txt
      functionality.cpp
      functionality.hpp
      main.cpp

In top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

    add_subdirectory(src)

CMake processes file `CMakeLists.txt` in directory `src`.


# Compartmentalising build logic

    # src/CMakeLists.txt
    set(
      src_source_files
      file1
      file2
      file3
      )
    add_executable(executable ${src_source_files})

Variables defined in callers are available in callee, but not the other way around,

Using subdirectories enables clear structure and modularity.


# Programming CMake

Variables can hold lists:

    set( src_files main.cpp functionality.cpp functionality.hpp )

Variables can be dereferenced

    set(another_list ${src_files})

The value of `another_list` is set the value of `src_files`.

Nested example:

    set(var files) # var = "files"
    set(yet_another_list ${src_${var}}) # yet_another_list = "src_files"



# Programming CMake

Conditionals...

    if(expression)
      # Do something
    else()
      # Do something else
    endif()

and loops:

    set(mylist A B C D)
    foreach(var IN LISTS mylist)
      message(${var})
    endforeach()

# Checkpoint 1

Our project has grown! In addition to the code in ~main.cpp~, some new functionality was added to new source files~functionality.cpp~ and ~functionality.hpp~.

This code is now contained in a specific directory ~src/~, inside the project directory.

**Task**: Write the file ~CMakeLists.txt~ in ~src/~ and modify the top level ~CMakeLists.txt~ so that directory ~src/~ is processed.

# Target properties

CMake allows for a very fine-grained control of target builds, through
*properties*.

For example, the property `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` specifies the list of
directories to be specified with the compiler switch `-I` (or `/I`).

Properties can be set manually like variables, but in general CMake provides
commands for it:

    target_include_directories(main_executable
		                       PRIVATE
							   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
	)

*Properties are different from variables!*


# Creating a library

Similar to `add_executable()`:

    add_library(my_lib STATIC ${source_files})

Use ~SHARED~ instead of ~STATIC~ to build a shared library.


# Linking libraries (`PRIVATE`)

Library dependencies can be declared using the `target_link_libraries()` command:

    target_link_libraries(another_lib PRIVATE my_lib)

The `PRIVATE` keyword states that `another_lib` uses `my_lib` in its internal
implementation. Programs using `another_lib` don't need to know about `my_lib`.


# Linking libraries (`PUBLIC`)

Picture another dependency scenario:

-   `another_lib` uses `my_lib` in its internal implementation.
-   **and** `another_lib` defines some function that take parameters of a type defined
    in `my_lib`.

Programs using `another_lib` also must link against `my_lib`:

    target_link_libraries(another_lib PUBLIC my_lib)


# Link libraries (`INTERFACE`)

Picture another dependency scenario:

- `my_lib` only uses `my_lib` in its interface.
- **but not** in its internal implementation.

```
target_link_libraries(another_lib INTERFACE my_lib)
```

# Behaviour of target properties across dependencies

Many (**all?**) target properties are paired with another property
`INTERFACE_<PROPERTY>`. For instance

    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES

These properties are inherited by depending targets (such as
executables and other libraries).

Example:

    target_include_directories(my_lib INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

-   `PRIVATE`: sets `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.
-   `INTERFACE`: sets `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`.
-   `PUBLIC`: sets both.

# Checkpoint 2

Let's separate the funtionality from the executable itself:

    CMakeLists.txt
	src/
      <library>
	exe/
	  <executable>
Tasks:

1. Modify `src/CMakeLists.txt` so that a static library is created out
   of `functionality.cpp` and `functionality.hpp`.
2. Move `main.cpp` into a new directory `exe`, and add a `CMakeLists.txt` defining a new
   target that links against the library.
3. Modify the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` so that it processes both directories.

# Printing information with `message()`

    name = "Jane Doe"
    message(STATUS "Hello ${name}")

    -- The C compiler identification is GNU 8.3.0
    ...
    -- Hello Jane Doe
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done

# Options for `message()`

	message(STATUS "A simple message")

`STATUS` can be replaced by *e.g.* `WARNING`, `SEND_ERROR`, `FATAL_ERROR`
depending on the situation.

    message(SEND_ERROR "An error occurred but configure step continues")

    CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (message):
      An error occurred but configure step continues

    -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!


# Finding libraries

Libraries can be installed in various locations on your system.

CMake makes it easy to link against libraries **without having to know
where they are installed**:

    find_package(library_name CONFIG REQUIRED)

The above defines a new target (usually named `library_name`) that can now be linked
against other targets using `target_link_libraries`.


# "config" mode for `find_package`

    find_package(library_name CONFIG REQUIRED)

In "config mode", `find_package` will search for a
`<PackageName>Config.cmake` file.

This file specifies all the information CMake needs (particularly where
the library is installed).

This is usually given by the library vendor.


# Checkpoint 3

A new file `src/functionality_eigen.cpp` depends on the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library for linear algebra.

Task: Using `find_package`, modify the `CMakeLists.txt` in directory `src/` to
link target `cmake_course_lib` against Eigen.

*Hint: Useful instructions can be found at [Using Eigen in CMake Projects](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicCMakeGuide.html).*

*Note that keyword `NO_MODULE` is equivalent to `CONFIG`*

# "module" mode for `find_package`

Libraries don't always come with a CMake config file
`<PackageName>Config.cmake`. 

CMake can also find the library based on a file `Find<PackageName>.cmake`.
This behaviour corresponds to using `find_package` with the keyword `MODULE`:

    find_package(library_name MODULE REQUIRED)

Such *module files* are typically provided by CMake itself.

They can also be written for a particular use case if required.

# Package components

Often libraries are split into different components.

E.g. Boost: filesystem, thread, date-time, program-options, numpy...

Most programs only rely on a subset of components

    set(
      boost_components
      filesystem
      chrono
      )
    find_package(Boost MODULE REQUIRED COMPONENTS ${boost_components})

The CMake target for a component is `<PackageName>::<ComponentName>`
(*e.g.* `Boost::filesystem`).

# That's all, folks
